# TSWorkflow

*If you enjoy my [Google Workspace Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) work, please consider buying me a cup of coffee!*

**TSWorkflow** contains the **[code](Code.gs)** for the [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) workflow automation highlighted in my presentation given at **[SheetsCon-2020](https://sheetscon.com/)** - **"Automation with Apps Script"**.  

<br>


**TSWorkflow** showcases the power of **[Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script)** to automate [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) workflow using:  

| GOOGLE FORMS | GOOGLE SHEETS | GOOGLE DOCS | GOOGLE DRIVE | GMAIL |
| :-----------: | :---------: | :----------: | :----------: | :---: |

> :point_right: See this **[blog post](https://medium.com/@techstreams/g-suite-business-solutions-apps-script-powered-workflow-automation-4cb715ea5d0b)** for the **TSWorkflow overview** and **getting started guide**.

<br>

> :point_right: TSWorkflow demonstrates modern [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) features supported by the new [Apps Script V8 Javascript runtime](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/v8-runtime).  See this **[code](NoV8.gs)** if you're looking for the non-V8 version of TSWorkflow.

## Important Notes

* TSWorkflow is meant to *demonstate* [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) workflow automation with [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) and **should not be deployed in a production environment** without further development and testing. 

* TSWorkflow uses __Google Drive > My Drive__.  Code modifications are needed to enable it to work with [Shared drives](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7212025?hl=en).

* Check the [Apps Script Dashboard](https://script.google.com) for execution errors if TSWorkflow does not work as expected.
